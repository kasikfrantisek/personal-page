# Personal page

The website is not yet complete se here is a link to [staging](https://frantisek-kasik-staging.vercel.app/).

#### There is not much to say, this is a repository for my personal page.
Why is it public? Well I learn a lot each day and I am implementing new stuf here all the time. So you can check, my progress / how I think about stuff / new technologies, here in commits. Or you can just take a look at the code if you like some parts of my website.


#### Technologies:
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Framer motion
- Typescript
- react-hook-form
- emailJS

#### CI/CD:
That is done thanks to vercel and github actions. There is various actions happening in different environments or pushes and pull requests. You can check that out.
